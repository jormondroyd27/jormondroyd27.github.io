            <h2>Professional Profile</h2>
    
            <h4>I specialise in HTML, CSS, JS and Python</h4>
    
            <p>
                A pro-active problem solver who is driven to succeed regardless of the size of the task.
                I strive for excellence and am always determined to achieve my goals as part of a team, or as an individual.
                My strong communication skills enable me to confidently converse with my colleagues, as well as senior
                members of staff, in a comprehensible manner.
                I have an excellent eye for detail, which I use to detect trends and identify discrepancies when
                investigating the root cause of issues.
                Having spent the last three years working in the customer-focused analyst roles,
                I believe my skill set transfers aptly to the technology industry as I aspire to pursue a career as a
                Software Engineer.
